=== ASSIGNMENT ===


Show the Local Weather

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Note: Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (https://) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to CodePen.io via https://.


=== PSEUDOCODE === 

Get user's browser location 
Use that to pull from APIs weather
    example: "{"coord":{"lon":139,"lat":35},"weather":[{"id":520,"main":"Rain","description":"light intensity shower rain"},{"id":701,"main":"Mist","description":"mist","icon":"50n"}],"base":"stations","main":{"temp":9.09,"pressure":1006,"humidity":100,"temp_min":7,"temp_max":11},"visibility":1207,"wind":{"speed":2.1,"deg":10},"clouds":{"all":90},"dt":1511387280,"sys":{"type":1,"id":7618,"message":0.1723,"country":"JP","sunrise":1511299549,"sunset":1511336072},"id":1851632,"name":"Shuzenji","cod":200}" 
"Use the endpoint: https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/. Use this endpoint to get the weather at a location. To prevent abuses this server accepts GET requests only, and serves only the route /api/current?lon=:longitude&lat=:latitude. Images links are included in the JSON under weather[0].icon. This is enough to complete the challenge."     
    
    
Check temperature 

Display image based on weather + temp
    options:     
                rain 
                clouds - 
                    overcast 
                    few / scattered 
                    broken 
                clear - below 10 deg C, snow on mountain
                        above 10 deg C, meadow
                        above 15 deg C, beach
                        above 26 deg C, melting ice cream
                        above 32 deg C, panting dog
                        above 37 deg C, desert scene
Button to toggle between F / C
    Celcius to F conversion formula: T(°F) = T(°C) × 1.8 + 32

=== values from fcc weather API === 

"weather" condition = "main" - clear, clouds, rain 
                    "description" - scattered, broken, overcast, few (clouds);  light, moderate (rain)
                    "icon" - correlates 
temperature =  "main" > "temp"
